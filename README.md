# Comp 2040 Assignment 1
This is the first assignment of my Python Essentials course.
I created a Python program that analyzes different text files and outputs useful statistics.
This assignment will be divided by tasks in order to successfully present those statistics as an output file.
## Task 1
- The program must read text from a file named exactly:
`input.txt`
## Task 2
Write functions that generate the following statistics from the text:

- Word count
- Unique word count
- Character count (with and without spaces)
- Average word length
- Most common word(s) and their frequency
